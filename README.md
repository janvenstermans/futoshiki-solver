# futoshiki solver

Futoshiki is a puzzle of 5x5 grid, where each row and grid takes numbers 1 up to 5. 
The puzzle input contains some ">" and "<" signs between grid elements. Based on these sings, the grid must be completed.

This projects attempts to construct a solver for this puzzel.

In the process, a general system will be developed for solving a "permutation square", i.e. a square where a number of input values is to be found in each row and column.
This will be usable in other puzzles, most notably sudoku puzzles.
